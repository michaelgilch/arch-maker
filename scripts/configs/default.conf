# PARTITIONING
#
# The following partition information will automatically be
# applied at installation.

# describe how to format those pre-existing partitions and
# what to use them for.
#
# So, the first time using a new disk drive, there will be some
# manual setup prior to running the installation. Subsequent 
# reinstallations will not require re-partitioning, as long as
# nothing changes.
