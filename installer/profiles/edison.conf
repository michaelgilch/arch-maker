# 
# PARTITIONING
#
# The following partition information will automatically be
# applied at installation.
# 
# Prior to running the installation, fdisk should be used to
# create the necessary partitions. The following settings
# describe how to format those pre-existing partitions and
# what to use them for.
#
# So, the first time using a new disk drive, there will be some
# manual setup prior to running the installation. Subsequent 
# reinstallations will not require re-partitioning, as long as
# nothing changes.
#
